That‚Äôs setting a very high bar, and, for now, I‚Äôm not sure Alyx clears it. The game is fighting VR‚Äôs inherent hardware limits, a pandemic-related headset shortage, and the difficulty of building a game for a new platform. While it‚Äôs about as long as the landmark Half-Life 2, with my game clocking in at 15 hours, it doesn‚Äôt feel as big or as narratively and mechanically fresh. It advances the series‚Äôs main plot, but it doesn‚Äôt come close to resolving it.

Students from Boston University to UCLA, from South Louisiana Community College to Northwestern University, have recently created or resurrected Minecraft servers and shared their creations on Discord chats, in Facebook meme groups, and on Reddit threads. The boom of college Minecraft servers has begun. These servers have the express purpose of bringing students together and building, oftentimes focused on recreating their college campuses. Searches for Minecraft server hosting have peaked to unprecedented levels in the last few weeks, and thousands of students are discussing college servers, most notably on the Facebook group "Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens."
